## Pronto eslinter

Just another `eslint` runner for the pronto ecosystem. Just that this one supports Github suggestions

### Motivation

During a hackathon we needed a tool to generate eslint messages in our pull requests along with code change suggestions
similar to the way it is done in [pronto-rubocop](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto-rubocop)
